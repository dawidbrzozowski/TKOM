# TKOM

## Currently Lexer part implemented.

## Running demo lexer from file:
python -m lexer.lexer --file_path <PATH_TO_FILE>

## Running demo lexer from stdin:
python -m lexer.lexer --lexer_type stdin

Input your code, when 'stdin code >' prompt shows up.
When you're finished with writing your code - type 'DONE'.
